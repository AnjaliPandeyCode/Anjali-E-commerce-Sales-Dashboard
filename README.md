In this mini-project, I analyzed online sales data and built a dashboard that shows:
- Total sales, profit, quantity, and average order value
- Sales by states, categories, and sub-categories
- Top customers and payment methods
- Monthly profit trends

## What I Learned

- How to use Power BI to clean and connect data
- Creating measures and calculations using DAX
- Designing charts like bar, pie, donut, line, area, scatter, and maps
- Using filters and slicers to make dashboards interactive

## Tools Used

- Power BI Desktop
- Sample sales dataset (from the tutorial)
- DAX and Power Query
